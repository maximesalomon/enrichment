This is a technical challenge done by Maxime Salomon for Clearbit.

## Project

Build a standalone tool/webpage which allows visitors to try our Enrichment product, and then captures their email. Timebox to a few hours or as you see fit.

You are free to use your creativity, but there is one requirement: The tool offers a max of 5 free enrichments before showing an email capture form.
